### RECOMMENDATION

•	It will be highly recommended for the companies to also produce a car whose engine uses, Petrol than diesel, this is to make their company make more sales, as most of City products uses Petrol.
•	Petrol is also easier to get compared to the other types of fuel, this will also determine the preference people will consider while buying car
•	The distance the car can also cover is also a major fact that determines how far the sales the company will also make.
•	It is advisable for one to register is company as a car brand if one has interest in car business has people have confidence in buying product from the companies than from an individual.
•	Lastly, the other companies should work on their brands to enhance their sales.
